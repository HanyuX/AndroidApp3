This is the third assignment - stress meter. 
We use grid view layout to show the pictures. After we click the picture, it will jump to another activity to show that picture. When you submit, the app will exit and record the stress value associated with the picture. You can view the result in the result tab.
All codes are implemented by Weiqiang_Liu and Hanyu_Xue.
